// Inteface is like class difference is whn we are using in extends keywords in second class of inheritance 
// but here we use implements words inplace of extends words in inheritance 
// but also like in inheritance extends keyword may use all upper class 
//but here implements keywords is used for interface class but class will also write but it should be public ....this is difference
